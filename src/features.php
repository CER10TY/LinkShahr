                    <h1>What is this?</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Quicksha.re is a way to share files between any devices.
                    The way it works is simple: Choose one or more files and decide how long they should be saved. Once the files are uploaded, you are given a token for each one. 
                    With this token, you can download individual files on any device, anywhere, at any time. After the tokens expire, the files are deleted from the server and you will no longer be able to access them.</p>

                    <h1>Who made it?</h1>
                    <p class="lead">I made it ;) I'm a software developer from Germany with ~2 years of professional experience. 
                    You can check out my blog at <a href="https://www.soeren.codes/" class="text-secondary">soeren.codes</a> or jump straight to my <a href="https://github.com/CER10TY" class="text-secondary">GitHub</a>.</p>

                <li>
                    <h1>What purpose does it have?</h1>
                    <p class="lead">I was personally getting frustrated with sharing documents between my different devices, especially on the go.
                    Whenever I had found an interesting document that I wanted to have a look at later, I had no quick and easy option.
                    Using e-mail or Dropbox proved to be a cumbersome process, especially when I had only a few minutes.
                    With Quicksha.re, I can now easily upload files, save the tokens and download them later.</p>
